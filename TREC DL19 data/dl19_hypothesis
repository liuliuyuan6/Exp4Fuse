The eggs hatch within 2 to 12 days.2. **Larva**: The larvae emerge from the eggs and feed on organic debris, including flea feces. This stage lasts about 5 to 11 days, during which they grow and prepare for pupation.3. **Pupa**: After the larval stage, the fleas spin cocoons and enter the pupal stage. This can last from a few days to several months, depending on environmental conditions and the presence of a host.4. **Adult**: Once conditions are favorable and a host is detected (usually through vibrations or heat), the adult flea emerges from the cocoon ready to feed and reproduce.

This helps to slow down water movement, allowing it to soak into the soil instead of washing away valuable topsoil. Additionally, contour plowing improves water retention, promotes better moisture distribution, and can aid in preventing nutrient loss from the soil. Overall, this sustainable farming practice fosters healthier soils, which is essential for maintaining agricultural productivity over time.\"\"\""], [168216, "does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia", "\"\"\"Yes, Legionella pneumophila is a bacteria that can cause a type of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. This illness typically occurs when individuals inhale aerosolized water droplets containing the bacteria, which can often be found in sources like cooling towers, hot tubs, and plumbing systems. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches.

In urban areas like Bangkok, mornings often begin early, as many people start their day with a traditional breakfast which might include rice porridge or street food such as fried rice or noodles. Commuting is a significant part of daily life, with many using public transport like the BTS Skytrain or buses to navigate the busy city. Work hours typically align with the standard 9 to 5, but in bustling metropolises, many people work longer hours. The city life is vibrant, filled with shopping, entertainment, and a thriving food scene, where street food stalls are particularly popular. After work, people often meet friends or family for dinner, frequently enjoying communal dishes that encourage sharing.In contrast, rural areas reflect a more laid-back lifestyle closely tied to agriculture. Many morning routines involve tending to rice fields or other crops. The pace is slower, with community interactions often fostering a strong sense of belonging.

Initially, the U.S. maintained a stance of neutrality, largely reflecting the desire to avoid the entanglement in European conflicts. However, several key events shifted this position.One significant factor was the unrestricted submarine warfare conducted by Germany, which threatened American shipping and resulted in the sinking of civilian vessels, notably the Lusitania in 1915, leading to the loss of American lives. Additionally, the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany proposed a military alliance with Mexico against the U.S., further incited public outrage and fear of a direct threat to national security.Furthermore, economic interests played a crucial role. The U.S. had strong financial ties to the Allies, particularly in terms of loans and trade. As the war dragged on, the economic motivations to support the Allies grew stronger, as their victory would help ensure the repayment of debts owed to American banks.These factors, alongside growing humanitarian concerns about the conflict and a desire to promote democracy, ultimately led to a pivot in public sentiment. In April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, arguing that the world must be made \"safe for democracy.\" This\"\"\""], [405717, "is cdg airport in main paris", "\"\"\"No, Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) is not located in the central area of Paris.
